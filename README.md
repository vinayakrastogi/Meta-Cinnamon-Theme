 - For the best result keep the panel size 60+
 - to allow panel size to go above 60 :
      open /usr/share/cinnamon/cinnamon-settings/modules/cs_panel.py
      search maxi=60 and replace 60 with other number (to which you want panel size to be/)

 - It's Recommended to keep the main panel at top or bottom position
 - Dock used is Plank (Plank Theme included)

 - Right Most Applet will be similar to as shown in the screenshot. (Applet used : Screen Locker)
